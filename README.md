## Prerequisites

  - See examples in `/Example` directory

## Steps to pass the exam

- Choose [one or more of alternatives](https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Winter-2025-Exams/blob/main/README.md#choose-alternative)
- Clone and fill self assessment repo: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/SelfAssessment
  - Fill your skills before course in branch: `main`
  - Fill your skills after course in branch: `2025-winter`
  - Open pull request from `2025-winter` to `main` but do not merge it
- Fill this form: https://forms.gle/saZw1PRo9aiQiF1Y8
  - Double сheck if the form has been submitted, editing is allowed
  - A notification should be sent to your mailbox

## Choose alternative

- Solve tasks from this repo
  - In JavaScript: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Winter-2025-Exams/tree/main/Tasks
  - If you prefer any other language instead of JavaScript then translate the code into your language as close as possible
- Here is more difficult tasks in addition or instead of previous: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Winter-2025-Exams/tree/main/Difficult
- Open-source contribution: submit to google forms
- Conference talk or seminar participation: submit link to google forms
- For those who want technical interview: submit link to google forms
- For those who have projects instead of this exams tasks:
  - Pet-projects, commercial projects, practical programming experience in products
  - You need to create screencast video presentation of codebase and project functionality: 15-30 minutes length
  - Upload it to Youtube, Google disk or other hosting with video support and add link to this video in your project repository
- Articles: submit links to google forms
- MDN contribution: submit links to google forms

## Tasks

- Fork this repository: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Winter-2025-Exams
- Clone this repository to your machine or you can do everything in Github integrated VSCode IDE
- Create branch `exams`
- See directory `/Tasks` there are 38 tasks prepared in one of the worst possible implementation and style and N more tasks to be implemented from the scratch
- You can select from 3 to 6 tasks (except `difference.js` and `size.js`) to refactor and optimize
- In implemented tasks code works and gives right results. You need to change files but do not break functionality covered by tests
- In tasks without given implementation we have just tests and they should pass
- To improve code style you may use:
  - Eslint to check style and analyze syntax: https://eslint.org
    - Here is recommended eslint config: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Future/blob/master/eslint.config.js
    - Rules in sources: https://github.com/metarhia/eslint-config-metarhia
  - Prettier to optimize style and code layout: https://prettier.io
    - Here is config example: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Future/blob/master/prettier.config.js
  - Package.json example: https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Future/blob/master/package.json
- Use tests from `*.tests.js` files to check tasks functionality
  - For example run: `node size.test.js` to check `size.js` or `npm t` (to check all taks)
  - Output example: `Test size.js: Passed: 11 of 11`
  - If tests fails you will see something like: `Case: size(23456789) -> "23 mb", expected: "123 mb"`
- Your task is to improve (respect list priority):
  - Code readability
  - Code style
  - Simplicity
  - Quality
  - Supportability
  - Reliability
  - Testability
- I'd advice to find a few friends from the group and cross-review the code
- Here is a checklist of common problems we have in code:
  - Do not mutate function input parameters
  - Prefer arrow functions for JavaScript and `lambda` for `Python`
  - Preferably use `for..of` or `for` on a variable or `Array/map`, and avoid `for..in` and `forEach`
  - Use intermediate identifiers to separate long expressions
  - Prefer `const` and use `let` as a last resort, but never use `var`
  - Convert all magic values to constants
  - Follow the rules for naming identifiers
  - Think carefully about the names of identifiers so that when reading the code, everyone understands their contents
  - Don't make functions too long (5-10 lines preferably, ...20 is ok, but...)
  - Don't make a big stack of if statements, use arrays and objects instead
- Hints:
  - Use eslint and prettier, fix all warnings
  - Follow code style and naming conventions from lectures and code examples
  - Respect 2 space indentation
  - Add empty line between semantic blocks for visual separation
  - Don't change incoming parameters
  - Decompose complex functions
  - Respect SRS (separation of concerns)
  - Respect SRP (single responsibility principle)
  - Prefer const, minimize let usage
  - Remove unneeded operations, calls, arguments, blocks, etc.
  - Prefer arrow functions
  - Use round brackets even for single argument lambda functions
  - Optimize loop invariant
  - Optimize lexical scope, minimize area of identifier visibility
  - Prefer `for..of` loops, sometimes use classical `for`, in a rare use `.map()`, try to avoid `.forEach()`
  - Use intermediate variables
  - Decompose long expressions
  - Return result of logical expression instead of `return true; else return false;`
- Make each refactoring and optimization step a separate commit
- It is important not to rewrite code from scratch but to improve it step by step
- At the seminar (see links above), I showed an example of how to optimize the code step by step
- When you're done, make a pull request to my repository
- Good luck!
